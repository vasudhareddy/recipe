Key Advantages of AppMap
	•	Code → Visual Map
Converts code into interactive maps, making architecture and flow easier to understand.
	•	Faster Onboarding
New developers quickly grasp system behavior without reading thousands of lines of code.
	•	Automatic Documentation
Generates up-to-date runtime diagrams, reducing manual documentation effort.
	•	Debugging Simplified
Shows execution flow, HTTP calls, DB queries, and dependencies in real time.
	•	Improves Code Reviews
Reviewers see architecture and behavior visually, not just raw code changes.
	•	Architecture Validation
Detects hidden dependencies, cycles, and violations of architectural rules.
	•	Security & Compliance
Helps identify unexpected data flows and risky dependencies early.
	•	Testing Insights
Visualizes which parts of code/tests execute, improving coverage and spotting gaps.
	•	Tool Integrations
Works inside VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and GitHub for continuous insights.
	•	Team Collaboration
Maps are shareable across teams, aligning developers, architects, and testers.

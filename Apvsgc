AppMap vs. GitHub Copilot

1. Core Purpose
	•	AppMap → Observability + Understanding
	•	Helps you see how your code actually runs (controllers → services → DB queries).
	•	Turns runtime behavior into visual maps for debugging, docs, onboarding, and reviews.
	•	GitHub Copilot → Code Generation
	•	Helps you write code faster by suggesting snippets inline.
	•	It doesn’t understand your app’s runtime execution or architecture.

2. Output
	•	AppMap:
	•	Sequence diagrams, dependency graphs, coverage maps, execution traces.
	•	Explains why code behaves the way it does.
	•	Copilot:
	•	Autocompletes code, generates boilerplate, and provides function templates.
	•	Explains only at a text level (not runtime visualization).

3. Use Cases
	•	Where AppMap shines (better than Copilot):
	•	Debugging: Visual trace of failing tests.
	•	Onboarding: New devs “see” flows instead of reading code.
	•	Code Reviews: Review behavior changes, not just diffs.
	•	Architecture: Detect hidden dependencies, cycles, or data leaks.
	•	Testing Insights: Show exactly what’s covered, and what’s not.
	•	Where Copilot shines:
	•	Writing repetitive boilerplate code.
	•	Suggesting API usage examples.
	•	Converting pseudocode into functions.

4. Developer Experience
	•	AppMap: Works like a runtime X-ray → you record a test or run, then get a map.
	•	Copilot: Works like a pair programmer → suggests what you might type next.
